short_answer,Explain the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial.,,"Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Quadratic Polynomial
For a quadratic polynomial, there is a direct and fundamental relationship between its zeroes (the values of the variable for which the polynomial's value becomes zero) and its coefficients (the numerical factors of the terms).

Let's consider a standard quadratic polynomial:
p(x) = ax² + bx + c
where a, b, and c are real number coefficients and a ≠ 0.

Let α (alpha) and β (beta) be the two zeroes of this polynomial. This means that p(α) = 0 and p(β) = 0.

The relationships between these zeroes (α and β) and the coefficients (a, b, c) are given by two key formulae:

1. Sum of the Zeroes (α + β)
The sum of the zeroes is equal to the negative of the coefficient of x divided by the coefficient of x².

Formula:
α + β = -b / a

2. Product of the Zeroes (α × β)
The product of the zeroes is equal to the constant term divided by the coefficient of x².

Formula:
αβ = c / a",,CBSE,Class 10,Mathematics,Polynomials,,medium,3,,75,FALSE
