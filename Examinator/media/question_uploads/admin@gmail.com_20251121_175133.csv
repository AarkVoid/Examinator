short_answer,Explain the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial.,,"Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Quadratic Polynomial
For a quadratic polynomial, there is a direct and fundamental relationship between its zeroes (the values of the variable for which the polynomial's value becomes zero) and its coefficients (the numerical factors of the terms).

Let's consider a standard quadratic polynomial:
p(x) = ax² + bx + c
where a, b, and c are real number coefficients and a ≠ 0.

Let α (alpha) and β (beta) be the two zeroes of this polynomial. This means that p(α) = 0 and p(β) = 0.

The relationships between these zeroes (α and β) and the coefficients (a, b, c) are given by two key formulae:

1. Sum of the Zeroes (α + β)
The sum of the zeroes is equal to the negative of the coefficient of x divided by the coefficient of x².

Formula:
α + β = -b / a

2. Product of the Zeroes (α × β)
The product of the zeroes is equal to the constant term divided by the coefficient of x².

Formula:
αβ = c / a",,CBSE,Class 10,Mathematics,Polynomials,,medium,3,,75,FALSE

short_answer,Prove that (1 - cos²θ) = sin²θ.,,"Proof that (1 - cos²θ) = sin²θ
This identity can be proven using the fundamental Pythagorean identity in trigonometry.

Step 1: Start with the Fundamental Identity
The most fundamental trigonometric identity is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem applied to a right-angled triangle. It states:

sin²θ + cos²θ = 1

This identity is true for any angle θ.

Step 2: Rearrange the Equation
To prove that 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ, we simply rearrange the fundamental identity. We isolate sin²θ on one side of the equation.

Starting with:
sin²θ + cos²θ = 1

Now, subtract cos²θ from both sides of the equation:

sin²θ + cos²θ - cos²θ = 1 - cos²θ

Step 3: Simplify
On the left-hand side, + cos²θ - cos²θ cancels out, leaving us with:

sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ

This is exactly what we set out to prove. We can also write it as:

1 - cos²θ = sin²θ",,CBSE,Class 10,Mathematics,Trigonometry,,hard,3,,100,FALSE

short_answer,Solve the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 using factorization method.,,"Solving x² - 5x + 6 = 0 by Factorization
Step 1: Set up the equation
We have the quadratic equation:
x² - 5x + 6 = 0

Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression
We need to find two numbers that satisfy the following conditions:

Their product is equal to the constant term, +6.

Their sum is equal to the coefficient of the middle term, -5.

Let's list the factor pairs of +6:

(1, 6) → Sum = 7 ❌

(2, 3) → Sum = 5 ❌

(-1, -6) → Sum = -7 ❌

(-2, -3) → Sum = -5 ✅

The two numbers we are looking for are -2 and -3.

Step 3: Write the factored form
Using these two numbers, we can factor the quadratic expression:
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0

*(You can verify this by expanding: (x - 2)(x - 3) = x² - 3x - 2x + 6 = x² - 5x + 6)*

Step 4: Apply the Zero Product Property
The Zero Product Property states that if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero.

So, we set each factor equal to zero:

(x - 2) = 0

(x - 3) = 0

Step 5: Solve for x
Solve each of the simple equations from the previous step:

x - 2 = 0 → x = 2

x - 3 = 0 → x = 3",,CBSE,Class 10,Mathematics,Quadratic Equations,,medium,3,,50,FALSE

short_answer,"Explain the difference between mean,median and mode with examples.",,"Core Concept
Measures of Central Tendency are single values that attempt to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set. However, they each define ""center"" differently.

1. Mean (The Average)
What it is: The mean is the arithmetic average of all the numbers in the dataset. It is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values.

When to use: It is the most common measure, but it is best used when the data is symmetrical and has no extreme outliers.

Key Characteristic: It uses every value in the dataset, which makes it sensitive to extreme values (outliers).

Formula:
Mean = (Sum of all data values) / (Number of data values)

Example:
Consider the dataset of test scores: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88

Calculation:

Sum = 85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 88 = 433

Number of values = 5

Mean = 433 / 5 = 86.6

Effect of an Outlier:
Now, let's replace the last score with a very low one: 85, 90, 78, 92, 20

New Sum = 85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 20 = 365

New Mean = 365 / 5 = 73
The single low score (20) pulled the mean down significantly from 86.6 to 73, which may not be a true representation of the class's performance.

2. Median (The Middle Value)
What it is: The median is the middle value in a dataset that is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

When to use: It is the best measure to use when the data is skewed or contains extreme outliers, as it is not affected by very high or very low values.

Key Characteristic: It is a positional average and is robust to outliers.

Steps to Find:

Arrange the data in order (smallest to largest).

Find the middle position.

Example 1 (Odd number of values):
Using the original test scores: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88

Arrange in order: 78, 85, 88, 90, 92

The middle value is 88.

Median = 88

Example 2 (Even number of values):
Dataset: 15, 22, 17, 19, 25, 30

Arrange in order: 15, 17, 19, 22, 25, 30

The two middle values are 19 and 22.

Median = (19 + 22) / 2 = 20.5

Effect of an Outlier:
Using the skewed dataset: 20, 78, 85, 90, 92

The data is already in order. The middle value is 85.

Notice that the median (85) is much closer to the majority of the data than the mean (73) was. The outlier (20) had no effect on it.

3. Mode (The Most Frequent Value)
What it is: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). If no number repeats, there is no mode.

When to use: It is most useful for categorical data (e.g., favorite color, brand of phone) to describe which category is most common. It can also be used for numerical data to identify the most typical value.

Key Characteristic: It is the only measure that can be used with nominal data (data in categories).

Example 1 (One Mode):
Dataset: 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9

The number 7 appears three times, which is more than any other number.

Mode = 7

Example 2 (No Mode):
Dataset: 12, 15, 18, 20, 25

No value repeats.

There is no mode.

Example 3 (Bimodal):
Dataset: 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8

The numbers 4 and 7 both appear twice.
